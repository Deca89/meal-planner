                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <p>Preheat the oven to 450 .
In large skillet, over medium heat warm the olive oil. Add the onions, shallots and mushrooms. Cook until the onions are translucent. Remove from the heat.
In a small food processor add the dried apricots, raisins, dried cranberries, parsley and the onion mushrooms mixture.  Pulse for a few times until everything is minced and well combined.
Cut the tenderloin in half crosswise. Butterfly each sections making sure not to go completely thru the meat.
Salt and pepper generously each section. Spread the onion mushroom mixture over on side. Place the other half of the meat  over the mixture and seal the sides with toothpicks. Season generously with salt and pepper on each side.
In the same pan that the onions were cooked, heat  teaspoon of olive oil and add the pork tenderloin. Sear each side for about 3-5 minutes.
Place in the hot over and cook for another 20 to 30  minutes, or until no juices are running off the pork tenderloin.
Remove from the oven, transfer the meat on a dish and cover with aluminum foil.
Pour off any fat from the pan, or bits of meat that may have fallen from the pork.  Add the marsala and port wine. Bring to a boil and with a spatula scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Add any pan juices from the tenderloin and continue cooking until the sauce is reduced to  cup. Remove from the heat and add the butter and cream. Swirl around to ensure butter is melted.
Remove the toothpicks and cut the pork tenderloin crosswise. Arrange on a plate and pour the sauce over it, or alongside.</p>
